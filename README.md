bamboo-vagrant-install
===================

A project that uses Vagrant and Puppet to create and boot either a VirtualBox VM or Amazon EC2 instance and then download and install a copy of Bamboo 5.4.  

## Notes

1. This is intended as a proof of concept and is not intended to be a full provisioning solution for Bamboo.
2. You will need to supply your own Bamboo license.
3. You will need an Amazon Web Services account to use the AWS provider
4. A quick-start guide for using this project is available [here](http://www.lwndev.com/posts/2013/4/21/tutorial-using-the-vagrant-aws-provider-plugin-to-create-a-bamboo-ci-server-in-the-cloud)
5. Credit where credit is due: This project is based off of Nicola Paolucci's Stash provisioning example https://bitbucket.org/durdn/stash-vagrant-install.git. Check out https://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/03/instant-java-provisioning-with-vagrant-and-puppet-stash-one-click-install/ for more details
